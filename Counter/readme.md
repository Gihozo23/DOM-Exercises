# Manipulating the DOM
The goal was to create an interactive counter where the user can enter a starting number, increment or decrement it, and reset it back to the original value. 
However if no valid number is entered then the default value will set to zero.
The color of the number display changes based on its positivity or negativity. 
The code should adhere to demonstrate understanding and practice using these concepts: document.querySelectorAll(); forEach(); addEventListener(); currentTarget property; classList; textContent.
